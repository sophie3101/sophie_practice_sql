Identify the employee(s) working under manager manager_id=13 who have achieved the highest target. Return each such employeeâ€™s first name alongside the target value.

```
select first_name, target
from salesforce_employees
where manager_id=13 and target=(select max(target) from salesforce_employees WHERE manager_id=13)
```
