Transactions are a fundamental concept of all database systems. The essential point of a transaction is that
it bundles multiple steps into a single, all-or-nothing operation. 

Use the BEGIN statement to explicitly start a transaction
Use the COMMIT statement to apply the changes permanently to the database.
Use the ROLLBACK statement to undo the changes made to the database during the transaction.
