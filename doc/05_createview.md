a table is stored data, but a view is like an alias for a query

| Feature           | `CREATE VIEW`                                 | `CTE (WITH ...)`                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**    | A saved, reusable **virtual table**           | A temporary, inline **named subquery**             |
| **Persistence**   | **Persistent** — stored in the database       | **Temporary** — only exists during query execution |
| **Use cases**     | For repeated use across many queries          | For modular, readable, single-use queries          |
| **Performance**   | May be optimized by the engine; depends on DB | Inlined into the query; optimized per use          |
| **Permissions**   | Can be granted/restricted                     | Inherits permissions of the main query             |
| **Updatable**     | Often, yes (with restrictions)                | N/A — not stored, so not updatable                 |
| **Can reference** | Any table or view                             | Other CTEs, but only within the query              |

A CTE, or Common Table Expression, is a temporary, named result set defined within a SQL query. You define it using the WITH clause, and it's used to simplify complex queries by breaking them into modular parts.

When to Use What:
✔ Use CTEs when:

You need temporary subqueries for clarity.

You’re writing a one-off or complex query.

You need recursive querying (CTEs support recursion).

✔ Use Views when:

You want to reuse logic across queries/reports.

You want to abstract or simplify business logic.

You want others to query data without exposing base tables.
